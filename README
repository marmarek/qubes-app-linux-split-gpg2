==== About ====

Since Gnupg 2.1.0 the private gpg keys are handled by the gpg-agent. This
allows to split the gpg2 (cmdline tool - handles public keys, etc.) and the
gpg-agent which handles the private keys. Purpose of this project is to split
gpg2 and gpg-agent between two Qubes domains. Since normally the gpg-agent is run
locally no filtering is provided. So to make this a meaningful security feature
the main function is the filtering of the commands from the less trusted domain
running gpg2. The rest are some script to "tunnel" the gpg-agent-commands
through Qubes RPC.

The server is the domain which runs the (real) gpg-agent.
The client is the domain which which access the server via Qubes RPC.

The server domain is generally considered more trustfull then the client domain.
This implies that the response from the server is _not_ santizied.


==== Requirements ====

- Python 3.5 or newer
- GnuPG 2.1 or newer

==== Building ====

=== Debian packages ===

cd /path/to/split-gpg2-source
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

=== RPM packages ===

cd /path/to/split-gpg2-source
rpmbuild -ba rpm_spec/split-gpg2.spec
rpmbuild -ba rpm_spec/split-gpg2-dom0.spec


==== Installation ====

Install the the debian or the rpm on your vm-template.

Install the dom0-rpm in dom0. (Or just create a proper
/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.Gpg2).

Create ~user/.split-gpg2-rc in the server and in the client domain.
See /usr/share/split-gpg2/examples/split-gpg2-rc.example for an example and the
available options.

Enable the split-gpg2-client service in the client domain either via the gui or
via 'qvm-service gpg-client-vm enable split-gpg2-client'. Restart the client domain.

You should now be able the run gpg2 in the client domain.

For keys for which you have the secret part you need to import the **public**
part in both the client and the server domain. The secret part should only be
imported in the server domain.

Other public keys should only be imported in the client domain.
